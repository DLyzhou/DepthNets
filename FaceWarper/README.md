# FaceWarper

FaceWarper is a program that uses the results from DepthNet to apply a 3D affine transform (warp) to a source face image. It uses a client-server architecture. The server, FaceWarperServer, is programed in C++11. A reference Python implementation of a client, FaceWarperClient, is provided. Finally, the Python script "warp_dataset.py" is provided to apply the 3D affine transforms inferred by DepthNet on a full dataset.

## Usage with DepthNet
You first need to build FaceWarperServer in order to use it. Detailed instructions on how to build it is provided in a section below.

Then, with the results obtained from running DepthNet (affine transforms, 2D keypoints and depths), run the Python script "warp_dataset.py" to generate warped faces. The following figure gives an overview of how FaceWarper works. In the previous step, DepthNet found the face 2D keypoints and their depth in the source image, and computed the affine transform to warp the source image into the pose of the target image. The target itself is not used by FaceWarper, it is presented in the figure only to better understand the result.

Run "warp_dataset.py" as follows:

```
python warp_dataset.py --results "/path/to/results" --server_exec "./FaceWarperServer/build/FaceWarperServer" "/path/to/dataset"
```
Where "/path/to/results" is the path you want the warped faces to be saved to and "/path/to/dataset" is the path to the dataset. This dataset must contain the results generated by DepthNet. The dataset folder is assumed to contain the following subfolders :
- "affine" : the affine transforms.
- "depth"  : the depth of the 2D keypoints.
- "keypoints" : the 2D keypoints in the source images.
- "images" : the source images.

## FaceWarperServer
FaceWarperServer is a C++11 application that applies a 3D affine transform to a mesh. It acts as a server that listens on the standard input. A visualization window is shown on the desktop. The image in this window is scaled to ease visualization, but the processing is done at the source texture resolution.

The server supports Linux and Windows.

### Dependencies
To build FaceWarperServer, the following libraries are required :
- GLEW
- freeglut
- GLM
- libpng (requires zlib)

On a Debian/Ubuntu Linux distribution, these dependencies can be installed with the following packages :
- libglew-dev
- freeglut3-dev
- libglm-dev
- libpng-dev

### Pre-built binaries
Pre-built binaries for Windows are provided in the "/FaceWarperServer/binaries/Windows" folder.

### Build
A CMake CMakeLists.txt is provided to build FaceWarperServer. To build on Linux, the helper shell script "build_linux.sh" is provided. To build on Windows, the helper Batch script "build_windows.bat" is provided. It supposes that the required libraries are located in "FaceWarperServer\lib" directory.

If you have problems building with CMake on Windows, a Visual Studio 2017 project is also provided in the "windows_build" directory.

If one of the dependencies can't be found by CMake, use the "-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=" option to tell CMake where to find them. For example, if CMake can't find GLEW :
```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/glew/glew-2.1.0/build/" ..
```

## warp_dataset.py
The Python program "warp_dataset.py" launches FaceWarperServer and sequentially sends each face in the dataset to be warped.

## Implementation details

### FaceWarperClient
FaceWarperClient is a Python package that can manage a FaceWarperServer and send warp commands to the server. It is used by "warp_dataset.py" to communicate with the FaceWarperServer. The package can be useful if you want to write a custom script to send commands to a FaceWarperServer instead of using the supplied "warp_dataset.py".

### Warp command format
This section presents the command format used to send warp commands to FaceWarperServer. These are implementation details that are not necessary to understand if you just want to use the supplied FaceWarperClient package or the supplied execution script 'warp_dataset.py'. It is useful is you want to implement a new client.

The FaceWarperServer listens on the standard input for warping commands. Each warping command is a space delimited line containing the following information, in order:

1. source image file path
2. source 2D keypoint file path
3. source keypoint depth file path
4. affine transform file path
5. output image path

Once the server has finished processing the command, it writes "ready" on a new line on the standard output to notify the client that it is ready to receive a new warping command.
